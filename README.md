A WEB-BASED APPLICATION THAT TRACKS DONATIONS AND IDENTIFIES DONOR PATTERNS USING MACHINE LEARNING.
Donation is a voluntary act of helping those in need, serving to enhance the well-being of vulnerable populations, and fostering a sense of social responsibility within communities. 
However, the current donation system faces several challenges, such as the emergence of fraudulent individuals masquerading as NGOs, misappropriation of donations for personal gain, lack of transparency in ensuring donations reach their intended recipients, and difficulties faced by NGOs in locating and convincing donors to contribute. 
A web-based application system is proposed to address these issues, leveraging machine learning to track donations and identify donor patterns. This system aims to enhance accountability and trust in the donation process. Noteworthy examples of related initiatives include the Impact Guru donation App and the Feeling Blessed Donation App. 
The development of the proposed system will employ an Object-Oriented Analysis and Design Approach, ensuring a systematic and efficient implementation. The chosen methodology for development will be Rapid Application Development. 
Key diagrams such as the use case, class diagram, and entity relationship diagram will be utilized to effectively represent and describe the proposed system. 
To ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the system, rigorous testing will be conducted. This will include both unit testing, focusing on individual components or modules, and system testing, evaluating the system. 
Through these tests, the functionality and performance of the system will be thoroughly assessed, ensuring a robust and reliable solution. In terms of implementation, the proposed system will utilize a range of programming languages and technologies. 
Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be employed to develop the system, leveraging their respective strengths and capabilities to create a comprehensive and user-friendly web application.
